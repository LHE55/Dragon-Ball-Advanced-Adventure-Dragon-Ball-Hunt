This is a Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure Randomizer called Dragon Ball Hunt.
In this Randomizer you need to find all seven Dragon Balls.
In the RAR file is the tracker, made with unity and the .exe file is the pythonbased randomizer itself.

This randomizer changes a lot of things around and I try to explain them all a bit here.
- New Goal: Finding all 7 Dragon Balls will end the game.
- Itemrandomizer: All Items are shuffled around.
- All levels are unlocked from the start. You should go to Kame-House to trigger a Cutscene that saves that state.
- Random Fighter: In every Level you have a random fighter out of the 30 possible.
- Hints: At the end of the most levels you get a Hint what item is at a specific itemspot.
- Cutscene-Items: There are 4 Items that you get in cutscenes. Two of them,randomly selected which ones, you get from the tournaments now and two from other no item levels.
- KI-Upgrades in 1 V 1 stages: The maximum KI-Bar in the 1 V 1 Leves (like the Tournaments) is depending on the found KI-Upgrades
- Level Changes: Nearly every level got changed to make them possible with all of the fighters (changed jumps and too narrow caves etc.)
- Cloud-Level enabled: Before just Goku and Krillin could do the levels on the clouds, now nearly eveyone can!

The Tracker is a easy tool where you can put in the fighter you are playing, in some levels two fighters, what items are where and if you have done the level.
When the level is marked as done the owned Section (icons at the bottom) are changed accordingly.

Known Problem:
Using a certain seed gives you the same characters but not same items... Will fix soon hopefully!
